# Micro Fluidized Bed Reaction Analyzer

a.k.a MFBRA, it's an apparatus to avaliate the development of a chemical reaction tipically. A MFB is used to conduct the reaction gas-solid, or gas-gas with solid catalict and analyze the evolution monitoring the gas products in a mass spectometer.

It's used to improve gas-solid contact, better control of the reaction temperature, less use of reactants and it's safer then a larger reaction.
