# Gas back mixing

Related to the permanence time of the gas in the fluidized bed. Less back-mixing (less average time the gas spends in the bed) leads to more control of the reactions, to obtain intermediate products for example.

Measured experimentally trhough  the concentration after the bed of a marker gas injected in a pulse. The more disperse the exit pulse, more back-mixing ocurred.
