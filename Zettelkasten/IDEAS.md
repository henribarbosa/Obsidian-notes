# IDEAS
* How does the bidispersed bed circulates? {1} 
	* With or without mixing? {2}
	* Is there a critical angle or velocity that changes de behaviour? [[Obliquity]]
	* Direction of "vorticity" of the particles
	* Does it have a change of behaviour with velocity (channeling) {3}

# To-do
* Pre-processing
	* Ask Danilo what he does
	* Subtract background
	* Homogenize the picture (adjust bright and dark for each area)? Remove shadows? 
	* Try to make then binary keeping the ratio beetwen bright and
