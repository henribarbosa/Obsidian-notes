# IDEAS
* How does the bidispersed bed circulates? {1} 
	* With or without mixing? {2}
	* Is there a critical angle or velocity that changes de behaviour? [[Obliquity]]
	* Direction of "vorticity" of the particles
	* Does it have a change of behaviour with velocity (channeling) {3}

# To-do
* Pre-processing
	* Ask Danilo what he does
	* Subtract background
	* Homogenize the picture (adjust bright and dark for each area)? Remove shadows? 
	* Try to make then binary keeping the ratio beetwen bright and dark constant inside plugs?
* Processing
	* Find column width automatically (for the first frame only)
	* Mark bottom and plugs (bottom for the first frame only)
	* Calculate velocity fields ( $x$, $y$, $v_x$, $v_y$)
	* Save particles trajectories ($t_{ini}$ , $N_{frames}$ , \n ($x$, $y$,)) in a file when the particle is lost
*
