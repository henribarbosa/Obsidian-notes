# Liu, van Wachem - 2019 - Comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of CFD-DEM simulations of bubbling fluidized beds
## Metadata


## Highlights
Simulations of particle-fuid fow in industrial systems with complex geometry are reported — location: []() ^ref-61295

---
parallelization or effcient algorithm of CFD-DEM models, making it a promising technique for a large-scale simulation [18–24]. In recent years, it has become possible to use CFDDEM models to study some industrial problems — location: []() ^ref-735

---
has released a suite of detailed measurements of a bubbling fuidized bed, which is named as Small Scale Challenge Problem (SSCP) — location: []() ^ref-54673
