* Experimental setup
	* 1mm and 4mm beds
	* 0-10Â° inclination
	* 85 and 165$\mu m$ particles

* Definitions
	* Normalized bed height: $H_N = \frac{H - H_0}{H_0}$
	* Normalized liquid velocity: $U_{L,N} = \frac{U_L - U_{mf}}{U_{mf}}$


* Results
	* Greater angles decrease bed expansion ($H_N$) more proeminent with smaller particles
	* Greater velocity ($U_{L,N}$) to form a region with lower particle fraction
