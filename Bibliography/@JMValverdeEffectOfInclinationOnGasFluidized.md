Authors : J.M. Valverde, A. Castellanos, M.A.S. Quintanilla, F.A. Gilabert
Year : 2007

* Investigation of packing in inclined fluidized bed of Gedart type C' particles (particles with cohesion, but fluidize in aglomerates)
* Inclination reduces velocity of sedimentaion
* Explores heterogenity of fluidization
* Mentions that circulation prevents segregation
